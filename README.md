# Marginal Python hacks
This is a repository of various small Python hacks so that they have
somewhere to live.  The only relation between them is that I wrote
them all.

## [Safer shell commands](safer-shell-commands/README.md)
Safer, or at least less dangerous, shell commands from templates.
Python 2.7 or 3.*

## [Wrapper](wrapper/README.md)
Tiny shell wrappers for Python programs which set `PYTHONPATH` &c.
Any Python version, Unix or Linux.
