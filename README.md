# Marginal Python hacks
This is a repository of various small Python hacks so that they have
somewhere to live.  The only relation between them is that I wrote
them all.

## [Safer shell commands](safer-shell-commands/)
Safer, or at least less dangerous, shell commands from templates.
[Documentation](safer-shell-commands/README.md).  Python 2.7 or any 3.

## [Wrapper](wrapper/)
Tiny shell wrappers for Python programs which set `PYTHONPATH` &c.
[Documentation](wrapper/README.md).  Any Python version, Unix or Linux.

## Testing
`make test` will run such tests as there are.  Tests are run
automatically by GitHub Actions: the status is below.
